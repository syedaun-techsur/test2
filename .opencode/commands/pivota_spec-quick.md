<objective>
Execute small, ad-hoc tasks with Pivota Spec guarantees (atomic commits, STATE.md tracking) while skipping optional agents (research, plan-checker, verifier).

Quick mode is the same system with a shorter path:
- Spawns pivota_spec-planner (quick mode) + pivota_spec-executor(s)
- Skips pivota_spec-phase-researcher, pivota_spec-plan-checker, pivota_spec-verifier
- Quick tasks live in `.planning/quick/` separate from planned phases
- Updates STATE.md "Quick Tasks Completed" table (NOT ROADMAP.md)

Use when: You know exactly what to do and the task is small enough to not need research or verification.
